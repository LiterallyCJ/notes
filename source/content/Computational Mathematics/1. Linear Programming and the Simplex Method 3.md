## Forms

### Canonical form

$$
\begin{matrix}
\text{max} &\sum^n_{j=1} &c_j &x_j \\
\text{s.t.} &\sum^n_{j=1} &a_{ij} &x_j &\leq &b_i, &\forall i \in \{1, m\} \\
& & &x_j &\geq &0, &\forall j \in \{1, n\}
\end{matrix}
$$

In this form, we can see that we are explicitly maximising an objective function (since the keyword max is used on the first line)

The objective function is subject to some constraints which are on the second line and beyond.

This form is useful for geometric interpretations of the problem because:
* The inequalities are used to form bounds
* We can see if its maximisation or minimisation easily (so we can decide if there is a solution for unbounded objective functions)

The inequalities may be a nuisance for some problems, so strict equalities may be more useful.

### Standard form

$$
\begin{matrix}
\text{min} &\sum^n_{j=1} &c_j &x_j \\
\text{s.t.} &\sum^n_{j=1} &a_{ij} &x_j &= &b_i, &\forall i \in \{1, m\} \\
& & &x_j &\geq &0, &\forall j \in \{1, n\}
\end{matrix}
$$
This form is important because equalities are used instead of inequalities.
