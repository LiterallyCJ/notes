## Objective functions

Using the decision variables from the last lecture, we have:
$$
\underbrace{0.02}_{C_A} x_A + \underbrace{0.03}_{C_B}x_B
$$
Here, we have labelled the coefficients.

We rewrite this using:
$$
\begin{gather*}
C = 
\begin{pmatrix}
C_A \\
C_B
\end{pmatrix}
\ x= 
\begin{pmatrix}
x_A \\
x_B
\end{pmatrix} \\ \\
f = C \cdot x = \sum^i_{i\in\{A,B\}}C_ix_i
\end{gather*}
$$
Writing the objective function in this compact form is useful with more complex problems.

## Feasible region

If you think of a point on a graph where all of the constraints of the problem are satisfied, we can call that point feasible. These points are the possible solutions.

The feasible region is a combination of all of the constraints given in the problem drawn on a graph, creating a region.

A bounded feasible region means that it is a closed shape. Some problems may be unbounded meaning there are an infinite amount of solutions.


## Level curves

Remember the objective function:
$$
\text{max } z = f(x) = 0.02x_A + 0.03x_B
$$

We then draw level curves $z = \text{constant}$. (set $z$ to a constant)

You follow the normal to the level curves with increasing value of $z$. (A line that is at 90 degrees to the level curve)

The last feasible point crossing the level curve is optimal. (Move the level curve up the normal until there is only a single point that intersects the level curve)
