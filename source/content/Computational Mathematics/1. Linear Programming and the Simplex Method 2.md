## Objective functions

Using the decision variables from the last lecture, we have:
$$
\underbrace{0.02}_{C_A} x_A + \underbrace{0.03}_{C_B}x_B
$$
Here, we have labelled the coefficients.

We rewrite this using:
$$
\begin{gather*}
C = 
\begin{pmatrix}
C_A \\
C_B
\end{pmatrix}
\ x= 
\begin{pmatrix}
x_A \\
x_B
\end{pmatrix} \\ \\
f = C \cdot x = \sum^i_{i\in\{A,B\}}C_ix_i
\end{gather*}
$$
Writing the objective function in this compact form is useful with more complex problems.

## Feasible region

If you think of a point on a graph where all of the constraints of the problem are satisfied, we can call that point feasible. These points are the possible solutions.
