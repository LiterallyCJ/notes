Example problem:

| Food | Carbs | Protein | Vitamins |
| ---- | ----- | ------- | -------- |
| Eggs | 20    | 90      | 0.02     |
| Ham  | 10    | 200     | 0.5      |
Sam can only buy eggs ($1 each) and ham ($10 each).

Every day sam needs carbs (300g), protein (600g), and vitamins (1g).

*Decision:* How much of each to buy
*Objective:* Minimise cost
*Constraints* Get enough nutritu

<u>Decision variables</u>
The variables which we can control
$$
x_E, x_H \geq 0
$$
This is where $x_E$ represents the number of eggs and $x_H$ represents the number of ham.

<u>Objective function</u>
Lets us know what we are trying to optimise
$$
\text{min}_x \text{ cost} = 1x_E + 10x_H
$$

(Minimise the cost with eggs = 1 and ham = 10)

<u>Constraints</u>
The function which decides the rules for the optimisation
$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{min} &1 &x_E &+ &10 &x_h \\
&\text{subject to} &20 &x_E &+ &10 &x_h &\geq & 300 \\
& &90 &x_E &+ &200 &x_h &\geq & 600 \\
& &0.02 &x_E &+ &0.5 &x_h &\geq & 1 \\
& & &x_E, & & &x_h &\geq & 0 \\
\end{align*}
