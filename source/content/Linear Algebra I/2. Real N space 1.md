The real n-space, $\mathbb{R}^n$ contains objects such as vectors, points, lines, and planes (the basic objects). $n \in \mathbb{N}$ denotes some positive integer.
## Real n-space $\mathbb{R}^n$

The real n-space $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the collection of all n-tuples of real numbers

$$
\underline{v} = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n), where\ all\ x_i \in \mathbb{R}
$$
These are called vectors where the numbers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ are said to be the vector coordinates of the vector $\underline{v}$

ex.

When $n = 1$, we get the real line $\mathbb{R}^1 = \mathbb{R}$, when $n = 2$, we get the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ and when $n = 3$, we get the real 3-space $\mathbb{r}^3$.
