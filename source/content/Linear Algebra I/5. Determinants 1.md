For any natural number $n \in \mathbb{R}$, let $M_n(\mathbb{R})$ denote the set of all $n \times n$ matrices with real entries. 
Given a square matrix $A \in M_n(\mathbb{R})$, various real numbers can be associated to it. For example, one useful quantity is the trace of $A$, defined as the sum of all diagonal entries.

## Axiomatic definition of a determinant

A function $D : M_n(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}$ is said to be a determinant if it satisfies the following 3 conditions:

(D1) for each $i, 1 \leq i \leq n, D$ is a linear function with respect to the $i$-th row. 
1. This means that if a matrix $B$ is obtained from a matrix $A \in M_n(\mathbb{R})$ by multiplying the $i$-th row by some $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ then $D(B) = \lambda D(A)$
2. if $A$ and $A'$ in $M_n(\mathbb{R})$ are to matrices which agree everywhere except the $i$-th row, and $A''$ is the matrix which agrees with $A$ ( and $A'$) everywhere except the $i$-th row and the $i$-th row of $A''$ is the sum of the $i$-th rows of $A$ and $A'$, then $D(A'') = D(A) + D(A')$
(D2) if $A \in M_n(\mathbb{R})$ has two equal rows, then $D(A) = 0$
(D3) $D(I_n) = 1$ where $I_n$ us the $n \times n$ identity matrix.
