## Finding the determinant of a matrix using row operations

Given any square matrix $A$, use row operations to bring $A$ to an upper triangular form, keeping track of how the determinant changes at each step.
Once this is done, the determinant of the upper triangular matrix can be calculated by taking the product of all diagonal entries.

ex.

Let $A = (a)$ be a $2 \times 2$ matrix. Let us show that $D(A) = ad - bc$. To prove this, we will consider several cases.

<u>Usage of a lot of 4.4 and 4.6</u>

Case 1: $a \neq 0$ then,
$$
D(A) = D (
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
)
\overset{R_2 \to R_2 - \frac{c}{a}R_1}{\longrightarrow}
D(
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
0 & d-\frac{c}{a}b
\end{pmatrix}
)
=
a \begin{pmatrix}
d - \frac{c}{a}b
\end{pmatrix}
=
ad - bc
$$
Case 2: $a = 0$, but $c \neq 0$ then,
$$
D(A) = D(
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
)
\overset{R_1 R_2}{\longrightarrow}
-D(
\begin{pmatrix}
c & d \\
0 & b
\end{pmatrix}
)
=
-cb
= ad - bc\ (\text{as } a = 0)
$$

Case 3: $a = 0$ and $c = 0$
$$
D(
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & b \\
0 & d
\end{pmatrix}
=
0 \cdot d
=
ad - bc\ (\text{as } a = 0, c = 0)
$$

## Existence and uniqueness of a determinant

For every natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a unique determinant $D : M_n(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying the axioms.

From the algorithm above, it proves that the value of the determinant can be calculated for any square matrix.

## Determinants and invertibility

An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is invertible if and only if $det(A) \neq 0$ 

(Right side proof) Suppose that $A$ is invertible. 
	This means that $A$ can be brought to $I_n$ via a sequence of row operations. $det(I_n) = \beta \cdot det(A)$ for some non zero number $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$. Therefore $det(A) = \frac{1}{\beta}det(I_n) = \frac{1}{\beta} \neq 0$

(Left side proof) Assume that $det(A) = 0$. Let us prove that $A$ is invertible by contrapositive: supposing that $A$ is not invertible, we will show that $det(A) = 0$:
	If $A^{-1}$ does not exist, then rank $A < n$. This means that some row echelon form $B$ of $A$ has a row of zeros. But $A$ can be brought to this echelon form $V$ via a sequence of row operations, so $det(B) = \beta \cdot det(A)$ for some $\beta \neq 0$. It follows that $det(A) = \frac{1}{\beta}det(B) = 0$ as $B$ has a zero row. 
	Since $\beta \neq 0$ this suggests that $det(A)$ is 0
