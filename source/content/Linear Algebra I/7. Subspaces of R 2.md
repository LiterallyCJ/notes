## Linear Span

A linear combination of vectors is when a set of vectors are added together with an arbitrary constant, i.e
$$
c_1 \vec v_1 + c_2 \vec v_2 + \dots + c_k \vec v_k
$$

A linear span of $\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k \}$ is the subspace of $\mathbb{R}$ consisting of all linear combinations of
