## Linear Span

A linear combination of vectors is when a set of vectors are added together with an arbitrary constant, i.e
$$
c_1 \vec v_1 + c_2 \vec v_2 + \dots + c_k \vec v_k
$$

A linear span of $\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k \}$ is the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ consisting of all linear combinations of $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k$
$$
span\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k\} = \{c_1 \vec v_1 + \dots + c_k \vec v_k | c_1, \dots, c_k \in \mathbb{R}\}
$$

We can see that $\vec v_i \in span\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k\}$, for each $i = 1, 2, \dots, k$, because we can take $c_i = 1$ and $c_j = 0$ for $j \neq i$

Also, $span\{\emptyset\} = \{\vec 0\}$ (The span of the empty set only contains the 0 vector)

## Range and column space

The column space of a matrix $A$ ($col(A)$) of size $m \times n$ is the set of all linear combinations of all of the columns. In other words, $col(A) = span\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_n\} \in \mathbb{R}^m$

Let $T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ be a linear transformation. The range/image of $T$ is the subset of $\mathbb{R}^m$ defined by $R(T) = \{T(\vec{x})| \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\}$  (The set of all outputs the transformation can produce)
