A system of linear equations is only consistent if and only if the corresponding augmented matrix in a row echelon form has no row of the form $0 \dots 0 | b$, where $b \neq 0$.

If the system is consistent then either there is a unique solution (i.e., there are no free variables) or there are infinitely many solutions (i.e, there are free variables). The number of free variables is equal to the difference between the number of variables and the number of non-zero rows in an echelon form of the augmented matrix of the system.
