Parametric equation of a plane

Suppose $P \in \mathbb{R}^b$ is a point, and $\underline{a}, \underline{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are vectors, which are not parallel and $\underline{a} \neq 0, \underline{b} \neq 0$. The plane $\Pi$ passing through $P$ and parallel to $underline{a}, underline{b}$ defined as the set of all points $R \in \mathbb{R}^n$ of the form $R = P + \lambda\underline{a} +\mu\underline{b}$, $\lambda, \mu \in \mathbb{R}$ are arbitrary real numbers.
In this case we will save that the plane $\Pi$ has the parametric equation
$$
\begin{align*}
\Pi:\ &R = P + \lambda\underline{a} + \mu\underline{b},\ \ 
\end{align*}
