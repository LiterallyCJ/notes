## Linear Independence

Given a set of vectors $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ how can we tell if any of these are a linear combination of the others?

We could reword this as given that $V = span\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k\}$, is $\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k\}$ a minimum spanning set of $V$?

To be able to find this out, we need to be able to use linear independence.

Let $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k$ be any vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$:
1. We will say these vectors are linearly independent if
$$
\begin{gather*}
c_1 \vec v_1 + \dots + c_k \vec v_k = \vec 0, \text{ with } c_1, \dots, c_k \in \mathbb{R}^n \\
\text{implies that } c_1 = c_2 = \dots = c_k = 0
\end{gather*}
$$
2. The vectors $v_1, \dots, v_k$ are linearly dependent if there exist $c_1, \dots, c_k \in \mathbb{R}$, not all zero, such that $c_1 \vec v_1 + \dots + c_k \vec v_k = \vec 0$. This equation is called a linear dependence relation among $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k$.  (This is because one of the vectors can be created using another other vectors)

### Characterisation  of linear dependence/independence

Vectors $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are linearly dependent iff the equation $A \vec x = \vec 0$ has a non-zero solution $\vec x = \vec c \in \mathbb{R}^k$ where $A$ is the matrix with column vectors $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k$.

Equivalently, $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k$ are linearly dependent iff the equation $A \vec x = \vec 0$ has only the trivial solution $\vec x = \vec 0 \in \mathbb{R}^k$

### Linear independence of n vectors in R

Let $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and let $A = (\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k)_{n \times n}$ be the square matrix with column vectors $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k$. Then $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k$ are linearly independent iff $det(A) \neq 0$.

This is true because if $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is linearly independent,
* The equation $A \vec x = \vec 0$ has only the trivial solution $\vec x = \vec 0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$
* The matrix $A$ is invertible
* $det(A) \neq 0$

### Characterisation of linear independence in terms of rank

Let $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k$ be some vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$
