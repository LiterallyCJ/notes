## Linear Independence

Given a set of vectors $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ how can we tell if any of these are a linear combination of the others?

We could reword this as given that $V = span\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k\}$, is $\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k\}$ a minimum spanning set of $V$?

To be able to find this out, we need to be able to use linear independence.

Let $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k$ be any vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$:
1. We will say these vectors are linearly independent if
$$
\begin{gather*}
c_1 \vec v_1 + \dots + c_k \vec v_k = \vec 0, \text{ with } c_1, \dots, c_k \in \mathbb{R}^n \\
\text{implies that } c_1 = c_2 = \dots = c_k = 0
\end{gather*}
$$
2. The vectors $v_1, \dots, v_k$ are linearly independent if there exist $c_1, \dots, c_k \in \mathbb{R}$, not all zero, such that $c_1 \vec v_1 + \dots + c_k \vec v_k = \vec 0$. This equation is called a linear dependence relation among $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k$.
