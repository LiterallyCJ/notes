## Inverting a matrix using cofactors

The matrix of cofactors of matrix $A$ is the matrix $C = (c_{ij})$ is the $(i, j)-th$ cofactor of $A$
The adjugate/adjunct of $A$ is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors.

Multiply the adjugate by $\frac{1}{det(A)}$ to get the inverse of $A$

## Determinant of a product

Let $E$ be an $n \times n$ elementary matrix and let $B$ be any $n \times n$ matrix. Then $det(E \cdot B) = det(E) \cdot det(B)$.
