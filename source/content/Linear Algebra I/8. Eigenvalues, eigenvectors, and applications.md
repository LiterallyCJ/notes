## Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix.

A number $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is said to be an eigenvalue of $A$ if there is a non-zero vector $\vec v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $A \vec v = \lambda v$
	This means when you multiply $\vec v$ by $A$, the direction does not change, only the scale. The amount that it is scaled is called the eigenvalue.

Any non-zero vector $\vec u \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $A \vec u = \mu \vec u$ for some $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ is called an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\mu$

Geometrically, $\vec v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is an eigenvector if $A$ stretches or shrinks it but preserves the line $L$ passing through $\vec v$

If the eigenvalue $\lambda$ is:
1. $\lambda > 1$ the vector is stretched
2. $0 < \lambda < 1$ the vector is shrunk
3. $\lambda = 0$ the vector collapses to $\vec 0$
