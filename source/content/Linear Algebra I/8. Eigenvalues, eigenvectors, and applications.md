## Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix.

A number $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is said to be an eigenvalue of $A$ if there is a non-zero vector $\vec v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $A \vec v = \lambda v$

Any non-zero vector $\vec u \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $A \vec u = \mu \vec u$ for some $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ is called an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\mu$

Geometrically, $\vec v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is an eigenvector if $A$ stretches or shrinks it but preserves the line $L$ passing through $\vec v$
