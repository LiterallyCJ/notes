## Orthogonal and normal sets

Let $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k$ be some vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$. 

We can say that $\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k\}$ is an orthogonal set if $\vec v_i \cdot \vec v_j = 0$ for all $i \neq j$, $1 \leq i,j \leq k$
(The dot product of all of the vectors is the zero vector meaning they are perpendicular)

$\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k\}$ is an orthonormal set if 
$$
\begin{gather*}
\vec v_i \cdot \vec v_j = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i \neq j \\
1 & \text{if } i = j \\
\end{cases} \\ \\
\text{for all } i,j, 1 \leq i,j \leq k
\end{gather*}
$$
(The dot product of all vectors is also 0, but the length of each vector is also 0)
	This comes from $i \cdot j = 1$ suggesting $||\vec v_i|| = 1$

## Orthogonal matrix

An $n \times n$ matrix is orthonormal if $P^T = P^{-1}$ ($P^TP = I_n$)
This also means that a matrix is orthogonal iff its column vectors form an orthonormal set.
