## Orthogonal and normal sets

Let $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k$ be some vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$. 

We can say that $\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k\}$ is an orthogonal set if $\vec v_i \cdot \vec v_j = 0$ for all $i \neq j$, $1 \leq i,j \leq k$
(The dot product of all of the vectors is the zero vector meaning they are perpendicular)

$\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k\}$ is an orthonormal set if 
$$
\begin{gather*}
\vec v_i \cdot \vec v_j = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i \neq j \\
1 & \text{if } i = j \\
\end{cases} \\ \\
\text{for all } i,j, 1 \leq i,j \leq k
\end{gather*}
$$
(The dot product of all vectors is also 0, but the length of each vector is also 0)
	This comes from $i \cdot j = 1$ suggesting $||\vec v_i|| = 1$

## Orthogonal matrix

An $n \times n$ matrix is orthonormal if $P^T = P^{-1}$ ($P^TP = I_n$)
This also means that a matrix is orthogonal iff its column vectors form an orthonormal set.

## Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process

The Gram-Schmidt process starts with a collection of linearly independent vectors, $\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and produces an orthonormal set of vectors $\vec w_1, \dots, \vec w_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $span\{\vec w_1, \dots, \vec w_k\} = span\{\vec v_1, \dots, \vec v_k\}$.

(A collection of vectors in which each vector cannot be made from another vector in the set turns into a set of vectors which are length 1 and perpendicular and on the same line as the original vectors)

<u>Step 1</u>
Get the first vector and use it as $\vec u_1$:
$$
\vec u_1 = \vec v_1
$$

<u>Step 2</u>
Using $\vec u_1$, we can get $\vec u_2$:
$$
\vec u_2 = \vec v_2 - (\frac{\vec v_2 \cdot \vec u_1}{\vec u_1 \cdot \vec u_1}) \vec u_1
$$

<u>Step 3</u>
Now, we can continue this using $\vec u_{k-2}$ to get $\vec u_{k-1}$:
$$
\vec u_{k-1} = \vec v_{k-1} - (\frac{\vec v_{k-1} \cdot \vec u_{k-2}}{\vec u_{k-2} \cdot \vec u_{k-2}}) \vec u_{k-2}
$$
	<u>Note</u>
	Remember that $\frac{\vec v \cdot \vec u}{\vec u \cdot \vec u}\vec u$ is the projection of a vector $\vec v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ along the vector $\vec u \in \mathbb{R}^n$
