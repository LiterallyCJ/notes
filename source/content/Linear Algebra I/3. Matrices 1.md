Suppose that $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ are natural numbers. an $m \cdot n$ matrix $A$ is a rectangular array with $m$ rows and $n$ colons. A =
$$
\begin{matrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \dots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & &\vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \dots &a_{mn}
\end{matrix}
$$
<u>Notes</u>
- The coefficients $a_{11}, a_{12}, \dots, a_{mn}$ are called the entries of the matrix. The entires are usually numerical.
- For any $i \in \{1, \dots, m\}$ and $j \in \{1, \dots, n\}$, the entry $a_{ij}$ is said to be the $(i,j)$th entry/element of $A$.
- $A_{ij}$ can also be used to denote $a_{ij}$
- $A = (a_{ij})$ is used to specify that $a_{ij}$ are the entries of the matrix $A$.
- The zero matrix of size $m \cdot n$ is the $m \cdot n$ matrix in which all entries are 0.
- The entries $a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33}, \dots$ are said to be diagonal
- if $m = n$ then $A$ is a square matrix of size $n$
- A square matrix $a$ is diagonal if $a_{ij} = 0$ whenever $i \neq j$.
