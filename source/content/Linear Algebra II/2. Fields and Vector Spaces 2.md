## Vector spaces

Let $F$ be a field.

A vector space over $F$ is an abelian group $(V, +)$ together with a scalar multiplication $ax \in V$ for all $a \in F$ and all $x \in V$ such that:
* 1st distribution law: $(a+b)x = (ax + bx)\ \forall a, b \in F\ \forall x \in V$
* 2nd distribution law: $a(x + y) = (ax + ay)\ \forall a \in F\ \forall x, y \in V$
* $(ab)x = a(bx)\ \forall a, b \in F\ \forall x \in V$
* $1 \cdot x = x\ \forall x \in V$

The first distributivity law means you can factorise and multiply out brackets when two of the things are scalars and one of them is a vector, and the second means the opposite.

Remember that elements of $F$ ($a, b$) are scalar and elements of $V$ ($x, y$) are vectors.
