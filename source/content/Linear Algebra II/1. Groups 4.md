## Symmetric groups

We write $S_n$ for the set of all bijective maps from $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ to itself. This is called the symmetric group on $n$ letters.
	A bijective map onto itself means that each element in the set is only hit once, and each of the hit elements are moved into another place. For this reason the set is also called the permutation group, and the elements of $S_n$ are called permutations.

An element of $S_n$ is a function, $\pi : \{1,2,\dots,n\} \to \{1,2,\dots,n\}$. In order to specify it, you only need to list the elements $\pi(1), \dots, \pi(n)$.

For example if we set $\pi(1) = 1, \pi(2) = 3, \pi(3) = 2$, this is an element of $S_3$.

However, the function needs to be a bijection, so the function $\pi(1) = 1, \pi(2) = 1, \pi(3) = 2$ is not an element of $S_3$ as it is neither injective nor surjective (because we have both $\pi(1) = 1$ and $\pi(2) = 1$).

We could use the form
$$
\sigma = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
2 & 1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
$$
To denote a map which sends $1 \to 2, 2 \to 1, 3 \to 3$.

If we have two maps $\pi$ and $\sigma$, $\pi \cdot \sigma(i) = \pi(\sigma(i))$
ex.
$$
\pi = 
\begin{matrix}
1 \to 1 \\
2 \to 3 \\
3 \to 2
\end{matrix}
\ \ \ \ \sigma = 
\begin{matrix}
1 \to 3 \\
2 \to 2 \\
3 \to 1
\end{matrix}
$$
$$
\begin{gather*}
\pi \cdot \sigma(1) = 3 \\
\pi \cdot \sigma(2) = 2 \\
\pi \cdot \sigma(3) = 1 \\
\end{gather*}
$$
However,
$$
\begin{gather*}
\sigma \cdot \pi(1) = 2 \\
\sigma \cdot \pi(2) = 1 \\
\sigma \cdot \pi(3) = 3 \\
\end{gather*}
$$
Therefore $\sigma \cdot \pi \neq \pi \cdot \sigma$ ($S_3$ is non-abelian)
