## Symmetric groups

We write $S_n$ for the set of all bijective maps from $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ to itself. This is called the symmetric group on $n$ letters.
	A bijective map onto itself means that each element in the set is only hit once, and each of the hit elements are moved into another place. For this reason the set is also called the permutation group, and the elements of $S_n$ are called permutations.

An element of $S_n$ is a function, $\pi : \{1,2,\dots,n\} \to \{1,2,\dots,n\}$. In order to specify it, you only need to list the elements $\pi(1), \dots, \pi(n)$.

For example if we set $\pi(1) = 1, \pi(2) = 3, \pi(3) = 2$, this is an element of $S_3$.

However, the function needs to be a bijection, so the function $\pi(1) = 1, \pi(2) = 1, \pi(3) = 2$ is not an element of $S_3$ as it is neither injective nor surjective (because we have both $\pi(1) = 1$ and $\pi(2) = 1$).

We could use the form
$$
\sigma = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
2 & 1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
$$
To denote a map which sends $1 \to 2, 2 \to 1, 3 \to 3$.

If we have two maps $\pi$ and $\sigma$, $\pi \cdot \sigma(i) = \pi(\sigma(i))$
ex.
$$
\pi = 
\begin{matrix}
1 \to 1 \\
2 \to 3 \\
3 \to 2
\end{matrix}
\ \ \ \ \sigma = 
\begin{matrix}
1 \to 3 \\
2 \to 2 \\
3 \to 1
\end{matrix}
$$
$$
\begin{gather*}
\pi \cdot \sigma(1) = 3 \\
\pi \cdot \sigma(2) = 2 \\
\pi \cdot \sigma(3) = 1 \\
\end{gather*}
$$
However,
$$
\begin{gather*}
\sigma \cdot \pi(1) = 2 \\
\sigma \cdot \pi(2) = 1 \\
\sigma \cdot \pi(3) = 3 \\
\end{gather*}
$$
Therefore $\sigma \cdot \pi \neq \pi \cdot \sigma$ ($S_3$ is non-abelian)

## Identity and inverse functions

The identity function is a function that sends $i$ to $i$ for every $i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$.

The inverse of an element is then the inverse function e.g. the inverse of the function $\pi(1) = 2, \pi(2) = 3, \pi(3) = 1$ is the function that sends $1 \to 3, 2 \to 1, 3 \to 2$ It is the function read backwards.

We can describe the function above with the table:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
2 & 3 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Using this form we can get the inverse:
$$
\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
2 & 3 & 1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 3 & 1 \\
1 & 2 & 3
\end{pmatrix} \\
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
1  & 2 & 3 \\
3 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
$$
This is done by just flipping the columns and then rearranging them

## Number of elements

<u>How many elements in $S_n$?</u>

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & \dots & n \\
\pi(1) & \pi(2) & & \pi(n)
\end{pmatrix}
$$
What we need to do is get the number of $\pi$'s possible

We can get the answer by considering $\pi(1)$ can be any of the numbers from the top row. If we choose $\pi(2)$, it can be any number from the top row except for the number chosen to be $\pi(1)$ and so on.

So we have:
* $\pi(1)$ has $n$ choices
* $\pi(2)$ has $(n-1)$ choices
* $\pi(3)$ has $(n-2)$ choices
* and this continues onto $n$ which has $1$ choice.
So the number of $\pi$'s possible becomes $n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \dots \cdot 2 \cdot 1$ or more simply $n!$

## Cycle notation

Let $n \geq 1$ and $s \leq n$. Let $a_1, \dots a_s \in \{1, \dots, n\}$ be pairwise distinct. The permutation $\pi \in S_n$ such that:
$$
\begin{gather*}
\pi(a_1) = a_2, \pi(a_2) = a_3, \dots, \pi(a_{s-1}) = a_s, \pi(a_s) = a_1 \\
\text{and } \pi(a) = a \text{ for } a\in \{1, \dots, n\} \backslash \{a_1, \dots, a_s\}
\end{gather*}
$$
The second line basically means that if an element in the group is not part of the cyclic part described, it just maps to itself.

This is all denoted as $\langle a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{s - 1}, a_s \rangle$.

Disjointed cycles are a set of cycles which do not have any numbers in common. 
For example, $\langle 1, 2, 3 \rangle, \langle 2, 5, 7 \rangle$ are not disjoint as they both have the value $2$, however $\langle 1, 2, 3 \rangle, \langle 4, 5, 6 \rangle$ are disjoint as there are no common numbers.

You can turn a product of disjoint cycles back into its products by going through the list one by one and finding smaller cycles within the cycle (some numbers aren't part of each cycle which is then checked again)

## Sign of a permutation

Let $n \geq 1$ and $\sigma \in S_n$. We write $\sigma = \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 \cdot \dots$ as a composition of cycles of lengths $s_1, s_2, \dots$. Then then number
$$
sgn(\sigma) := (-1)^{(s_1 - 1) + (s_2 - 2) + \dots} \in \{\pm 1\}
$$
