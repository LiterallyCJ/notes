$(F, +, \cdot)$ with two distinguished elements, $0 \neq 1$ is called a field when:

* $(F,+)$ is an abelian group, i.e:
   * $a + (b+c) = (a + b) + c$ for all $a, b, c \in F$ ($+$ is associative)
   * $a + b = b + a$ for all $a, b \in F$ ($+$ is commutative)
   * There exists an element $0 \in F$ such that $a + 0 = 0 + a = a$ for all $a \in F$ (there is a zero element)
   * For all $a \in F$ there exists $b \in F$ such that $a + b = b + a = 0$ (there are additive inverses)
   
* $(F - \{0\}, \cdot)$ is an abelian group
   * $a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$ for all $a, b, c \in F$ ($\cdot$ is associative)
   * $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all $a, b \in F$ ($\cdot$ is commutative)
   * There exists an element $0 \in F$ such that $a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a$ for all $a \in F$ (there is a unity/one element)
   * For all $a \in F$ there exists $b \in F$ such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a = 1$ (there are multiplicative inverses)
   
* $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$ for all $a,b,c \in F$ ($\cdot$ is distributive over $+$) *ORDER MATTERS*

This basically says addition of elements is an abelian group, multiplication is an abelian group, and you can multiply out brackets. This results in just adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing normally.

## Fields

A field is a set $F$ together with two binary operations on $F$ which we will refer to as addition and multiplication, such that:
* $F$ together with addition is an abelian group
* $F^\times := F \backslash \{0\}$ together with multiplication is an abelian group
* Is distributive
