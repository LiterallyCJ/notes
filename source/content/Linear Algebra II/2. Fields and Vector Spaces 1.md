$(F, +, \cdot)$ with two distinguished elements, $0 \neq 1$ is called a field when:

* $(F,+)$ is an abelian group, i.e:
   * $a + (b+c) = (a + b) + c$ for all $a, b, c \in F$ ($+$ is associative)
   * $a + b = b + a$ for all $a, b \in F$ ($+$ is commutative)
   * There exists an element $0 \in F$ such that $a + 0 = 0 + a = a$ for all $a \in F$ (there is a zero element)
   * For all $a \in F$ there exists $b \in F$ such that $a + b = b + a = 0$ (there are additive inverses)
   
* $(F - \{0\}, \cdot)$ is an abelian group
   * $a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$ for all $a, b, c \in F$ ($\cdot$ is associative)
   * $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all $a, b \in F$ ($\cdot$ is commutative)
   * There exists an element $0 \in F$ such that $a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = a$ for all $a \in F$ (there is a zero element)
   * For all $a \in F$ there exists $b \in F$ such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a = 0$ (there are additive inverses)
   
* $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$ for all $a,b,c \in F$ ($\cdot$ is distributive over $+$) *ORDER MATTERS*
