$(F, +, \cdot)$ with two distinguished elements, $0 \neq 1$ is called a field when:

* $(F,+)$ is an abelian group, i.e:
   * $a + (b+c) = (a + b) + c$ for all $a, b, c \in F$ ($+$ is associative)
   * $a + b = b + a$ for all $a, b \in F$ ($+$ is commutative)
   * There exists an element $0 \in F$ such that $a + 0 = 0 + a = a$ for all $a \in F$ (there is a zero element)
   * For all $a \in F$ there exists $b \in F$ such that $a + b = b + a = 0$ (there are additive inverses)
   
* $(F - \{0\}, \cdot)$ is an abelian group
   * $a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$ for all $a, b, c \in F$ ($\cdot$ is associative)
   * $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all $a, b \in F$ ($\cdot$ is commutative)
   * There exists an element $0 \in F$ such that $a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a$ for all $a \in F$ (there is a unity/one element)
   * For all $a \in F$ there exists $b \in F$ such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a = 1$ (there are multiplicative inverses)
   
* $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$ for all $a,b,c \in F$ ($\cdot$ is distributive over $+$) *ORDER MATTERS*

This basically says addition of elements is an abelian group, multiplication is an abelian group, and you can multiply out brackets. This results in just adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing normally.

## Fields

A field is a set $F$ together with two binary operations on $F$ which we will refer to as addition and multiplication, such that:
* $F$ together with addition is an abelian group
* $F^\times := F \backslash \{0\}$ together with multiplication is an abelian group
* Is distributive

If $a \in F$, we usually write:
	$-a$ for the negative inverse of $a$ (is unique)

If $0 \neq a \in F$ (non-zero a), we usually write:
	$a^{-1}$ for the multiplicative inverse

* $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$ with the usual addition and multiplication are fields
* The set $\mathbb{Z}$ with the usual addition and multiplication is not a field because there is no multiplicative inverse of $2$ for example in $\mathbb{Z}$.
* The set $\mathbb{F}_2 := \{0,1\}$ together with the following operations is a field:
	This set can also be thought of the $\mathbb{Z}$ modulo $2$
$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
+ & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 0
\end{array}
\ \ \
\begin{array}{c|cc}
\cdot & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1
\end{array}
$$
* Let $p$ be a prime. The set $\mathbb{F}_p := \{\vec 0, \vec 1, \dots,  \vec{p - 1}\}$ together with the addition table (using sudoku method) and the following multiplication is a field:
$$
\vec x \cdot \vec y := \overline{\text{remainder left when } xy \text{ is divided by } p}
$$

Let $F$ be a field. Then:
* $0 \cdot a = 0\ \forall a \in F$
* $(-a)b = -(ab)\ \forall a,b \in F$

<u>Proof:</u>

We have 
$$
\begin{align*}
0 + 0a &= 0a = (0 + 0)a = 0a + 0a \\
&\implies 0 = 0a
\end{align*}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
ab + (-a)b &= (a + (-a))b \\
&=0b \\
&= 0 \\
&\implies (-a)b \text{ is the additive inverse of } ab ,\text{ i.e, } (-a)b = (-ab)
\end{align}
$$
