<u>Proposition 1.3</u>

Let $G$ be a group. Then:

1. There exists precisely one identity element in $G$

2. For every $a \in G$ there exists precisely one right inverse (named $b$) to $a$. And ths $b$ is also a left inverse of $a$ (meaning that we also have $b \times a = e$). We write $a^{-1}$ for this inverse of $a$ (or $-a$ if the group operation is $+$)

<u>Proof</u>
Suppose $e$ and $e'$ are two identity elements in $G$
$$
\begin{gather*}
\implies e \times e' = e \\
\implies e \times e' = e' \\
\implies e = e'
\end{gather*}
$$
These results are true because $e'$ is an identity element and $e$ is also an identity element.

Let $b$ be a right inverse of $a$, and let $c$ be a right inverse of $b$
$$
\begin{align}
\implies a *(b*c) &= a*e \\
&= a \\
\text{and } a*(b*c) &= (a*b)*c \\
&=e*c \\
&=c\\
\implies a&=c \\
\implies b*a &=b*c = e
\end{align}
$$
The first line is possible because c is the right inverse of b, and because e is the identity element, $a*e = a$
