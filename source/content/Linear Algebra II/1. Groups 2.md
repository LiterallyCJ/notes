<u>Proposition 1.3</u>

Let $G$ be a group. Then:

1. There exists precisely one identity element in $G$
2. For every $a \in G$ there exists precisely one right inverse (named $b$) to $a$. And ths $b$ is also a left inverse of $a$ (meaning that we also have $b \times a = e$). We write $a^{-1}$ for this inverse of $a$ (or $-a$ if the group operation is $+$)
