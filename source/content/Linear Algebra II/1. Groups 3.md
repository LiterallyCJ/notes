## Group tables

The group table of a finite group $G = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$ is a table that looks like:
$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
* & \dots & a_j & \dots \\
\hline
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_i & \dots & a_i * a_j & \dots \\
\vdots & & \vdots
\end{array}
$$

This is a table whose $(i,j)$ entry is $a_i * a_j$

The trivial group is the group with one element. For example $e$ would have the group table:
$$
\begin{array}{c|c}
* & e \\
\hline
e & e
\end{array}
$$
A group with 3 elements ($e, a, b$ in this example) would have a group table:
$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
* & e & a & b \\
\hline
e & e & a & b \\
a & a & b & e \\
b & b & e & a
\end{array}
$$
(Also note that this means $a * b = a$ and therefore implying $b = e$)

These tables satisfy the "sudoku rules" because of rule 2:
For $a, b \in G$ there is a unique solution to $x * a = b$ and $x * y = b$. This means that if something has appeared once in a row or column it cannot appear again.
