Gaussian elimination doesn't always give a single solution, it could give 0 solutions or infinite solutions.

The cartesian product of two sets is the set of ordered pairs. For example if $G, H$ are sets,
$$
G \times H = \{(g,h): g \in G, h \in H\}
$$
In english $G \times H$ is a set which contains all of the pairs you can make with the items in each set.
e.g
$$
\begin{gather*}
G = \{0,1\}, H = \{1,2\} \\
G \times H = 
\end{gather*}
$$
