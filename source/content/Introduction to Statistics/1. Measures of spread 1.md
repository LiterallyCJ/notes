Single average $a$ which is representative of the whole sample
- Could be mean ect.

We can measure how far $a$ is from the data:

## <u>Sum of square errors</u>

$$
SSE(a) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - a)^2
$$
- Take each data point and subtract $a$
- Square the value
- Add them together

The value is squared to get the difference without the sign
## <u>Sum of absolute errors</u>

$$
SAE(a) = \sum_{n}^{i = 1}|x_i - a|
$$
Difference isn't squared, but absolute value is used instead
