## Random variables

For discrete variables, the probability function is the probability mass function (PMF), for continuous functions it is the probability density function (PDF).

A random variable maps each outcome in the sample space to a real number. For example consider a fair coin toss with outcomes head or tail. A random variable that maps head to 1 and tail to 0 looks like:
$$
Head \to 1,\ Tail \to 0
$$
We can denote this random variable as $X$ which is the number of heads obtained by tossing a single coin. The possible values for $X$ are 0 and 1.

## Discrete and continuous random variables.

A random variable is discrete if it takes a finite or countably infinite set of values (e.g. the number of apple users among 20 students; the number of credit cards a person carries). 
It is continuous if it can take any real value. Some variables mix discrete and continuous parts e.g. daily rainfall (0 on some days, or a positive continuous amount on other days)
