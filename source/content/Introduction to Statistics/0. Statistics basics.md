# Example data sets

Assume that we have data from $n$ randomly selected numeric sampling units, denoted as:
$x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$

Either:
- Discrete 
- Continuous
# Summarising categorical data

Categorical (not numeric) data can be summarised by using a table.
An example of this could be a table displaying number of heads and number of tails

# Measures of location

To find the "average" number which is representative of the set of data $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ there are many methods

## Mean average
$$
\bar x = \frac{1}{n}(x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n)
$$
## Median

The median of a sample is the middle value in the ordered list of the sample
$$
x_1 \le x_2 \le \dots \le x_n
$$
If the size of the sample is even, add the two middle values together and divide by 2

## Mode

The mode of a sample is the value that appears the most often
