# Summaries of a random variable

A random variable $X$ with either a pmf $f(x)$ or a pdf $f(x)$ can be summarised similar to means and variance of  data samples.

## Expectation

The mean of $X$ or the expectation is defined as:

$$
E(x) = 
\begin{cases}
\sum_{\text{all } x} x \cdot f(x) & \text{if } X \text{ is discrete} \\
\int^\infty_{-\infty} x \cdot f(x)\ dx &\text{if } X \text{ is continuous}
\end{cases}
$$
When the sum or the integral exists. Informally, you can describe the expectation as the sum or integral of "value $\times$ probability".

ex.
In a fair die, with each of the six sides having a probability of $\frac{1}{6}$ of landing face up, let $X$ be the number on the up-face of the die, then
$$
\begin{align}
E(X) 
&= \sum^6_{x = 1} x \cdot P(X = x) \\
&= \sum^6_{x = 1}\frac{x}{6} \\
&= 3.5
\end{align}
$$
