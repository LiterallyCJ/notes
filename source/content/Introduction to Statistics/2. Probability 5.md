## Independent events

Sometimes knowing that one event has happend changes the probability of another event. In other cases, it does not. In this case, we call the events independent of each other.

Events $A$ and $B$ are independent if $P(B|A) = P(B)$ if $P(A) > 0$, or $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$

If $A$ and $B$ are independent, so are $A'$ and $B'$

Proof:
$$
\begin{gather*}
\text{Want to show:} \\
P(A' \cap B') = P(A') \cdot P(B') \\
\end{gather*}
$$
$$
\begin{align*}
P(A' \cap B') &= P((A \cap B)') \\
&= 1-P(A \cap B) \\
&= 1−[P(A) + P(B) − P{A \cap B}] \\
&= 1−[P(A) + P{B} − P(A)P{B}] \\
&= [1−P(A) ] − P{B}[1−P{A}] \\
&= [1−P(A)][1−P(B)] \\
&= P(A')P(B')

\end{align*}
