### Bernoulli distribution

Bernoulli trials are independent trials with two outcomes, success or failure and a common success probability.

Suppose that we conduct one Bernoulli trial, where we get a success (S) or failure (F) with probabilities $P\{S\} = p$ and $P\{F\} = 1 - p$. Let $X$ be an indicator of success:
$$
X = 
\begin{cases}
1 &\text{if } S \\
0 &\text{if } F
\end{cases}
$$
Then $X$ has Bernoulli distribution with parameter p, written as $X ~ Bernoulli(p)$

The Bernoulli distribution has pmf
$$
f(x) = p^x(1-p)^{1-x}, x = 0,1
$$
hence,
$$
\begin{gather*}
E(X) = 0 \cdot(1-p) + 1p = p \\
E(X^2) = 0^2 \cdot(1-p) + 1^2p = p
\end{gather*}
$$
Therefore, 
$$
Var(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2 = p - p^2 = p(1-p)
$$

### Binomial distribution

In $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$, let $X$ be the number of successes, then X~Bin(n, p)

An outcome of the experiment is represented by a sequence of S and Fs (SSSS, SSFS, SSFF, ect.) that comprises of $x$ S' and $n-x$ F's. The probability associated with this outcome is

$$
\begin{align*}
P\{SS \dots FS \dots SF\} 
&= pp \dots (1−p)p \dots p(1−p)  \\
&= p^x(1−p)^{n−x }
\end{align*}
$$
For this sequence, $X = x$, but there are many other sequences which also give $X = x$, there are $\pmatrix{n \\ x}$ such sequences. Hence, 
$$
P(X=x) = \pmatrix{n \\ x} p^x(1-p)^{n-x}
$$

This is the pmf of the binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$.

#### Binomial theorem

For any positive integer $n$ and real numbers $a$ and $b$,

$$
(a + b)^n = b^n + \pmatrix{n \\ 1}ab^{n-1} + \dots + \pmatrix{n \\ x}a^xb^{n-x} + \dots + a^n
$$

Setting $a = p$ and $b = 1$ in the binomial theorem shows that $\sum^n_{x = 0}\pmatrix{n \\ x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x} = 1$
