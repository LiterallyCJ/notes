### Bernoulli distribution

Bernoulli trials are independent trials with two outcomes, success or failure and a common success probability.

Suppose that we conduct one Bernoulli trial, where we get a success (S) or failure (F) with probabilities $P\{S\} = p$ and $P\{F\} = 1 - p$. Let $X$ be an indicator of success:
$$
X = 
\begin{cases}
1 &\text{if } S \\
0 &\text{if } F
\end{cases}
$$
Then $X$ has Bernoulli distribution with parameter p, written as $X ~ Bernoulli(p)$

The Bernoulli distribution has pmf
$$
f(x) = p^x(1-p)^{1-x}, x = 0,1
$$
hence,
$$
\begin{gather*}
E(X) = 0 \cdot(1-p) + 1p = p \\
E(X^2) = 0^2 \cdot(1-p) + 1^2p = p
\end{gather*}
$$
Therefore, 
$$
Var(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2 = p - p^2 = p(1-p)
$$
