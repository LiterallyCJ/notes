Probability is used to express the uncertainty of events

Subjective probability is probability which is a guess or personal to someone
	e.g: I predict that $x$ team will win this football game

Probability can come from the long term relative frequency of a random experiment:
$$
\frac{\text{Number of repetitions resulting in A}}{\text{Total number of repetitions}}
$$
"Common knowledge" can be used to find probability, formally known as the Axioms of Probability.

- The set of all outcomes is called the sample space ($S$)
- An event is a particular result in an experiment
- Events are denoted in capital letters
- A composite event is when multiple are done simultaneously

The union ( $\bigcup$ ) of two events $A$ and $B$ are the outcomes of $A$, or $B$ or both at the same time.
The intersection ( $\bigcap$ ) of two events $A$ and $B$ are the outcomes that are in both events simultaneously.

$A$ and $D$ are mutually exclusive if $A \bigcap D = \emptyset$ where $\emptyset =$ the empty set
	This means $A$ and $D$ have no outcomes in common and therefore both events cannot happen simultaneously

- The compliment of an event is all of the outcomes not in the event

## Axioms of probability

$$
\begin{align}
A1:\ &P(s) = 1 \\
A2:\ &0 \le P(A) \le 1 \\
A3:\ &P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
\end{align}
$$
From this, we have:
$$
\begin{gather*}
P(A') = 1 - P(A)\\
\text{if } A \text{ and } B \text{ mutually exclusive, } P(A \cap B) = 0 \\ \\
\text{For mutually exclusive events, } A_1, A_2, \dots, A_k, \\
P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_k) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \dots + P(A_k) \\ \\
\text{General addition rule:} \\
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
\end{gather*}
