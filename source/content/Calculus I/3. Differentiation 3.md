## The derivative as a rate of change

The derivative $f'(x)$ is the slope of the tangent line to a function $f$ at a point $x$. There is an alternative view of the derivative as an instantaneous rate of change of $f$.

The rate of change is the amount by which $f$ changes in proportion to how $x$ changes. If we look at changing $x$ to $x + h$, then $f(x)$ changes to $f(x + h)$. The amount by which $f$ has changed is $f(x + h) - f(x)$, and taking this in proportion to how much $x$ has changed is the quotient:
$$
\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{(x + h) - x}
$$
This is exactly the slop of the secant line connecting the points $(x, f(x))$ and $(x + h, f(x + h))$.

As $h$ is made smaller and $x + h$ becomes close to $x$, we get a more accurate description of the rate of change of $f$ at $x$.
If take the limit as $h$ approaches 0, we get the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ at $x$.

In terms of an object moving in two dimensional space, if the path of motion is given by the function $y(t)$ then the derivative $y'(t)$ is the velocity of the object, and $y''(t)$ is the acceleration of
