The graph of a function has an asymptote if it approaches the graph of a straight line

The graph of a function $f$ has a vertical asymptote at a point $a$ if:
$$
\begin{matrix}
\lim_{x \to a^+}f(x) = \pm \infty & or & \lim_{x \to a^-}f(x) = \pm \infty
\end{matrix}
$$
This means that as $x$ gets closer to $a$, the $y$ value of the graph goes to infinity, becoming a straight vertical line.

The graph of a function $f$ has a horizontal asymptote $y = L$ where $L$ is a constant if:
$$
\begin{matrix}
\lim_{x \to \infty}f(x) = L & or & \lim_{x \to -\infty}f(x) = L
\end{matrix}
$$
This means that as $x$ approaches infinity, the $y$ value stops changing, and becomes fixed at a value $L$.

ex.

Determine whether the function $f(x) = \frac{x}{x - 2}$ has vertical or horizontal asymptotes.

Vertical asymptotes tend to occur at points where the function stops being defined. Here, we can see that $f$ is not defined when $x = 2$.
Think of the function $f$ as $x \cdot \frac{1}{x - 2}$ meaning that as $x$ approaches 2, $x$ tends to 2 and $x - 2$ becomes smaller and smaller. This means that $\lim_{x \to 2}f(x) = \infty$.
Therefore there is a vertical asymptote.

Now to get the horizontal asymptote, we take the limit to infinity. $\lim_{x \to \infty}$
