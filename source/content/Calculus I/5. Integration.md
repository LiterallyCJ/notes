## Antiderivatives

The idea is simple, given a function $f$, find another function $g$ such that $g' = f$. The formal definition is:

Let $f$ be a function. A function $g$ is an antiderivative of $f$ if $g$ is differentiable and $g' = f$

ex.
For example, since $\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}$, an antiderivative of $x^{n-1}$ is $\frac{1}{n}x^n$. By linearality, we can find antiderivatives and polynomials.

Suppose that $g(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$, and $c$ is a constant. Let $h(x)$ be a new function defined by $h(x) = g(x) + c$. Then $h$ is also an antiderivative of $f$.

<u>Proof:</u>
Since $g$ is an antiderivative of $f$, we have $g'(x) = f(x)$. To show that $h$ is an antiderivative of $f$, we need to show that $h'(x) = f(x)$ as well. We have $h'(x) = (g(x) + c)' = g'(x) = f(x)$ since the derivative of a constant is 0.

This means that antiderivatives are not unique and antiderivatives have no geometric meaning but can be used to find integrals.

## The definite integral

Let $f$ be a continuous function and consider its graph. We want to find the area under the curve between $x = a$ and $x = b$.

To approximate this area, we can use rectangles. Using the formula $A = b \times h$, we can fit a sequence of rectangles below the curve, with one corner of the rectangle touching the curve with area $L$. Because the rectangles are below the curve, $L \leq A$. 
We can also have rectangles above the curve which also touch the curve at one corner with area $U$. Because the are above the curve, $U \geq A$.

<u>Step 1:</u>
Divide $[a,b]$ into $n$ segments $[1, x_1], [x_1]$
