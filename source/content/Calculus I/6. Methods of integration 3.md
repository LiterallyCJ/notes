## Integration by Partial Fractions

This method is used to find the integral of rational functions in the form:
$$
\int \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\ dx
$$
where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials. The idea is to rewrite $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ as a sum of terms which are easier to integrate.

ex.
Find $\int \frac{x + 4}{x^2 - 5x + 6}\ dx$
