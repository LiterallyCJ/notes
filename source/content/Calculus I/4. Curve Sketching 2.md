## Mean Value Theorem

Having found local minimums and maximums, the next step is to try to determine on what intervals a function is increasing or decreasing. The key tool for doing this is the Mean Value Theorem

Let $f$ be a continuous function defined on the closed interval $[a, b]$ which is differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$. Then there is a point $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that:
$$
f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
$$
This means that there is some point $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that the slope of the tangent line at $c$ matches the slope of the secant line connecting $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$.

<u>Proof</u>

Using a special case, suppose that $f(a) = f(b) = 0$. Now, we ned to show that there is a $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = 0$.
Since $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, by the Extreme Value Theorem, $f$ has a maximum value on $[a, b]$. If the maximum occurs at $c \in (a, b)$, then $f'(c) = 0$.

$$
g(x) = f(x) - f(a) - \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}(x- a)
$$
$g$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ because it is the sum and difference of continuous functions. This means that it is also differentiable on $(a, b)$. $g(a) = 0$, $g(b) = 0$. This means that $g$ satisfies the special case, implying that there is a $c \in (a, b)$ such that $g'(c) = 0$.From the definition of $g$, we obtain:
$$
g'(x) = f'(x) - \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
$$

Thus, $0 = g'(c) = f'(c) - \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$, and therefore $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$
