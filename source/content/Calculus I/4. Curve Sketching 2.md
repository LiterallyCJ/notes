## Mean Value Theorem

Having found local minimums and maximums, the next step is to try to determine on what intervals a function is increasing or decreasing. The key tool for doing this is the Mean Value Theorem

Let $f$ be a continuous function defined on the closed interval $[a, b]$ which is differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$. Then there is a point $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that:
$$
f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
$$
This means that there is some point $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that the slope of the tangent line at $c$ matches the slope of the secant line connecting $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$.

<u>Proof</u>

Using a special case, suppose that $f(a) = f(b) = 0$. Now, we ned to show that there is a $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = 0$.
Since $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, by the Extreme Value Theorem, $f$ has a maximum value on $[a, b]$. If the maximum occurs at $c \in (a, b)$, then $f'(c) = 0$.

$$
g(x) = f(x) - f(a) - \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}(x- a)
$$
$g$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ because it is the sum and difference of continuous functions. This means that it is also differentiable on $(a, b)$. $g(a) = 0$, $g(b) = 0$. This means that $g$ satisfies the special case, implying that there is a $c \in (a, b)$ such that $g'(c) = 0$.From the definition of $g$, we obtain:
$$
g'(x) = f'(x) - \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
$$

Thus, $0 = g'(c) = f'(c) - \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$, and therefore $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$

## Intervals of increase and decrease

We now use the Mean Value Theorem to determine when a function is increasing or decreasing on an interval.

Let $f$ be a function defined on an interval $I$ and suppose $x_1$, $x_2$ are two points in $I$.
- If $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$ then $f$ is increasing on $I$.
-  If $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$ then $f$ is decreasing on $I$.
-  If $f(x_1) \leq f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$ then $f$ is non-decreasing on $I$.
-  If $f(x_1) \geq f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$ then $f$ is non-increasing on $I$.

- If $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \in I$ then $f$ is increasing on $I$
- If $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x \in I$ then $f$ is decreasing on $I$
- If $f'(x) \geq 0$ for all $x \in I$ then $f$ is non-decreasing on $I$
- If $f'(x) \leq 0$ for all $x \in I$ then $f$ is non-increasing on $I$

<u>Proof</u>

Let $x_1, x_2 \in I$ and suppose that $x_1 < x_2$. Since $f$ is differentiable on $I$ it is continuous on $I$. Therefore $f$ is continuous on $[x_1, x_2]$ and differentiable on $(x_1, x_2)$, so the Mean Value Theorem is applicable. By the Mean Value Theorem there is a point $c \in (x_1, x_2)$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$.

- Note: $x_2 - x_1 > 0$, so $f'(c)$ and $f(x_2) - f(x_1)$ have the same sign.
If $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \in I$ then $f'(c) > 0$, implying that $f(x_2) - f(x_1) > 0$. Thus $f(x_2) > f(x_1)$. As this is true for all $x_1 < x_2$ in $I$, the function $f$ must be increasing on $I$.
