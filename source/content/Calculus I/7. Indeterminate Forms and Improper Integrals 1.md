## L'Hospital's Rule

This rule is a method for working out a limit
$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
$$
when both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ approach 0, or when both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ approach $\pm\infty$.

Let $f$ and $g$ be differentiable functions with $g'(x) \neq 0$. Suppose that:
$$
\lim_{x \to a}f(x) = 0 \text{ and } \lim_{x \to a}g(x) = 0

$$
