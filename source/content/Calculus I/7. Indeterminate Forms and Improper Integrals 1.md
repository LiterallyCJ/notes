## L'Hospital's Rule

This rule is a method for working out a limit
$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
$$
when both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ approach 0, or when both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ approach $\pm\infty$.

Let $f$ and $g$ be differentiable functions with $g'(x) \neq 0$. Suppose that:
$$
\begin{gather}
\lim_{x \to a}f(x) = 0 \text{ and } \lim_{x \to a}g(x) = 0 \\
\text{if} \\
\lim_{x \to a}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L \\\\
\text{then,} \\
\lim_{x \to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L \\
\end{gather}
$$

ex.
$$
\lim_{x \to 1}\frac{\ln x}{1-x}
$$
Note that $\lim_{x \to 1} \ln x = 0$ and $\lim_{x \ to 1} 1-x = 0$, and both functions $\ln x$ and $1 - x$ are differentiable, and $(1-x)' \neq 0$. So the hypothesis of L'Hospital's Rule are fulfilled. As the derivatives of $\ln x$ and $1-x$ are $\frac{1}{x}$ and $-1$ respectively, by L"Hospital's Rule, we obtain,
$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{x \to 1}\frac{\ln x}{1-x} 
&= \lim_{x \to 1}\frac{\frac{1}{x}}{-1} \\
&= \lim_{x \to 1}-\frac{1}{x}  \\
&= -1 
\end{align}
$$
