## Concavity and Inflection Points

The second derivative will say something about whether the graph of $f$ is cupped upwards or cupped downwards.

Let $f$ be a differentiable function on an open interval $I$
- The graph of $f$ is concave up on $I$ if $f'$ is increasing on $I$
- The graph of $f$ is concave down on $I$ if $f'$ is decreasing on $I$

Remember that the derivative $f'(x)$ is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $x$. If $f'$ is increasing it means that as $x$ increases, the slope of the tangent lines of $f$ are increasing.

Graphically, a function is concave up if the tangent lines are below the graph, and concave down if the tangent lines are above the graph of $f$.
