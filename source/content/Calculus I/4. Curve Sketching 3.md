## Concavity and Inflection Points

The second derivative will say something about whether the graph of $f$ is cupped upwards or cupped downwards.

Let $f$ be a differentiable function on an open interval $I$
- The graph of $f$ is concave up on $I$ if $f'$ is increasing on $I$
- The graph of $f$ is concave down on $I$ if $f'$ is decreasing on $I$

Remember that the derivative $f'(x)$ is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $x$. If $f'$ is increasing it means that as $x$ increases, the slope of the tangent lines of $f$ are increasing.

Graphically, a function is concave up if the tangent lines are below the graph, and concave down if the tangent lines are above the graph of $f$.

A point $x_0$ is an inflection point of $f$ if the graph of $f$ has a tangent line at $x_0$ and the concavity of $f$ is opposite on opposite sides of $x_0$

Let $f$ be a function which is twice differentiable on an open interval $I$
1. If $f''(x) > 0$ on $I$ then $f$ is concave up on $I$
2. If $f''(x) < 0$ on $I$ then $f$ is concave down on $I$
3. If $f$ has an inflection point at $x_0$, then $f''(x_0) = 0$

The third case does not work in reverse. This is because it may be a local maximum or minimum, or a point which is not differentiable which means it is not a point of inflection.

<u>Proof</u>
Let $g = f'$, so $g' = f''$.
To say $g'(x) > 0$ on $I$ means $g$ is increasing on $I$, that is $f'$ is increasing on $I$. So by definition $f$ is concave up on $I$. 
Similarly, to say $g'(x) < 0$ on $I$ means $g$ is decreasing on $I$, so. $f'$ is decreasing on $I$. By definition, $f$ is concave down on $I$.

If $f$ has an inflection point at $x_0$ then the concavity of $f$ changes from the left to the right of $x_0$. For example if $f$ is concave up to the left of $x_0$ and concave down to the right of of $x_0$ then by rules 1 and 2, $f''(x) > 0$ on the left of $x_0$ and $f''(x) < 0$ on the right of $x_0$. This means that we must have $f''(x_0) = 0$. The same occurs vise versa if
