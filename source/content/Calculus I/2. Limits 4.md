## Intermediate value theorem:

If $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and $K$ is any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ then there is a $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f(c)=K$

This can be used to find zeroes in a function, showing that there is negative and positive numbers in a continuous function shows that there is a 0.

ex.

Let $f$ be continuous on $[a, b]$. if $f(a) < 0 < f(b)$, then there is a number $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that $f(c) = 0$

<u>Proof:</u>

Suppose $f(a) < 0 < f(b)$, the other case being proved similarly.
Since $f$ is continuous, $\lim_{x \to a}f(x) = f(a)$. That is as $x$ approaches $a$, $f(x) approaches $f(a)$.
As $f(a) < 0$ this means that if $x$ is close enough to $a$ then $f(x)$ also has to be less than 0.
Technically there is some small number $\epsilon_0 > 0$ such that $f$ is negative on the interval $[a, \epsilon_0)$. 
This line of reasoning will be used repeatedly as follows.

Let $S$ be the set of all values $epsilon$ for which $f$ is negative on $[a, \epsilon)$ that is,
$$
S = \{\epsilon | f \text{ is negative on } [a, \epsilon)\}
$$
Observe that S is nonempty since $\epsilon_0 \in S$ the set $S$ has an upper bound since $f(b) > 0$ implies that $f$ must be positive on some interval $(t, b)$, implying that $f$ is not negative on the whole interval $(a,b]$. So $b$ is an upper bound on $S$. Therefore, by the Least Upper Bound Axiom (Below), $S$ has a least upper bound $c$. Note: $c \leq b$.

We claim that $f(c) = 0$, which would prove this. 
- If $f(c) > 0$ then $f$ is positive on some interval of the form $(t,c)$ so $t$ is also an upper bound on $S$ and $t < c$. But this contradicts the fact that $c$ is the least upper bound on $S$.
- If $f(c) < 0$ then $f$ is negative on some interval of the form $(c,s)$, implying that $f$ is negative on the interval $[a,s)$, meaning that the least upper bound of $s$ must be at least as large as $s$. But this contradicts the fact that $c < s$.
- So, the only option left is $f(c) = 0$

This means that 0 exists in the between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.

## Bounded functions:

Let $f$ be a function on an interval $I$. Then $f$ has an upper bound if there is a number $M$ such that $f(x) \leq M$ for all $x \in I$. Also, $f$ has a lower bound if there is a number $N$ such that $N \leq f(x)$ for all $x \in I$. We say that $f$ is bounded if it has both an upper and lower bound.

## Extreme value theorem:

Let $f$ be a continuous function on a closed interval $[a, b]$. Then $f$ is bounded on $[a, b]$ and $f$ has both a minimum and a maximum value on $[a, b]$

This is useful for optimisation problems.

## The least upper bound axiom

Every nonempty set of real numbers has an upper bound that has a least upper bound

ex.

Let $s$ = (0,1)
