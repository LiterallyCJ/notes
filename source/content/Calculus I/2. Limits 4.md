## Continuous functions

A function $f$ is continuous at a point $a$ if $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$.
- If a function $f$ is not continuous at $a$, we say that $f$ is discontinuous at $a$.

ex.

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
2x + 1 &:x \neq 1\\
1 &:x = 1
\end{cases}
$$
This function is not continuous, because $\lim_{x \to 1}f(x) = 3$ (the function approaches 3 as x gets closer to 1, ignoring what happens at )
