## Intermediate value theorem:

If $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and $K$ is any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ then there is a $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f(c)=K$

This can be used to find zeroes in a function, showing that there is negative and positive numbers in a continuous function shows that there is a 0.

## Bounded functions:

Let $f$ be a function on an interval $I$. Then $f$ has an upper bound if there is a number $M$ such that $f(x) \leq M$ for all $x \in I$. Also, $f$ has a lower bound if there is a number $N$ such that $N \leq f(x)$ for all $x \in I$. We say that $f$ is bounded if it has both an upper and lower bound.

## Extreme value theorem:

Let $f$ be a continuous function on a closed interval $[a, b]$. Then $f$ is bounded on $[a, b]$ and $f$ has both a minimum and a maximum value on $[a, b]$

This is useful for optimisation problems.
