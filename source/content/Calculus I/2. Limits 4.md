## Continuous functions

A function $f$ is continuous at a point $a$ if $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$.
- If a function $f$ is not continuous at $a$, we say that $f$ is discontinuous at $a$.

ex.

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
2x + 1 &:x \neq 1\\
1 &:x = 1
\end{cases}
$$
This function is not continuous, because $\lim_{x \to 1}f(x) = 3$ (the function approaches 3 as $x$ gets closer to 1, ignoring what happens at 1). However, $f(1) = 1 \neq 3$ therefore it is discontinuous at 1.

A function $f$ is continuous on an open interval $(b, c)$ if $f$ is continuous at every point $a \in (b,c)$.

A function $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[b, c]$ if $f$ is continuous at $a$ for every $a \in (b, c)$ and it is continuous on the right at $b$, and continuous on the left at $c$.

## Arithmetic of Continuous Functions

Ig $f$ and $g$ are functions that are continuous at $a$, then:
$$
\begin{gather*}
f + g \text{ is continuous at } a \tag{a} \\
f - g \text{ is continuous at } a \tag{b} \\
fg \text{ is continuous at } a \tag{c} \\
\frac{f}{g} \text{ is continuous at } a \text{ provided that } g(x) \neq 0 \tag{d} \\
cf \text{ is continuous at } a \text{ for any constant } c \tag{e}

\end{gather*}
$$

<u>Proof [a]</u>
Since $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $a$, by definition of continuity, $\lim_{x \to a}f(x) = f(a)$ and $\lim_{x \to a}g(x) = g(a)$, Therefore, by the arithmetic of limits, 
$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{x \to a}(f(x) + g(x)) &= \lim_{x \to a}f(x) + \lim_{x\to a}g(x) \\
&= f(a) + g(a) \\
&=(f + g)(a)
\end{align}
$$
Since $f(a) + g(a) = (f + g)(a)$, we obtain that $\lim_{x \to a}(f(x) + g(x)) = (f + g)(a)$, so $f + g$ is continuous at $a$.

<u>Note:</u>
- This also means that any polynomial $p(x)$ us continuous for every $a \in \mathbb{R}$. Any rational function $r(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(c)}$ is continuous provided that $q(a) \neq 0$.

Let $g$ be a function that is continuous at $a$ and let $f$ be a function that is continuous at $g(a)$. Then the composition of $f \cdot g$ is continuous at $a$.
- As $x$ approaches $a$, we have $g(x)$ approaching $g(a)$. Let $g(x) = y$ and $g(y) = b$. Then as $y$ approaches $b$, we have $f(y)$ approaching $f(b)$. That is as $x$ approaches $a$ we have $f(g(x))$ approaching $f(g(a))$. so $f \cdot g$ is continuous.
