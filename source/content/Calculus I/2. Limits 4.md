Intermediate value theorem:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\text{If a function is continues and takes values: } c, d \\
\text{Where } c < d, \text {then it must take all values between c and d}
\end{gather*}
$$

If $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and $K$ is any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ then there is a $c \in $
