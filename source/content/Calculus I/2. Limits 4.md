## Intermediate value theorem:

If $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and $K$ is any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ then there is a $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f(c)=K$

This can be used to find zeroes in a function, showing that there is negative and positive numbers in a continuous function shows that there is a 0.

ex.

Let $f$ be continuous on $[a, b]$. if $f(a) < 0 < f(b)$, then there is a number $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that $f(c) = 0$

<u>Proof:</u>

Suppose $f(a) < 0 < f(b)$, the other case being proved similarly.
Since $f$ is continuous, $\lim_{x \to a}f(x) = f(a)$. That is as $x$ approaches $a$, $f(x) approaches $f(a)$.
As $f(a) < 0$ this means that if $x$ is close enough to $a$ then $f(x)$ also has to be less than 0.
Technically there is some small number $\epsilon_0 > 0$ such that $f$ is negative on the interval $[a, \epsilon_0]$. 
This line of reasoning will be used repeatedly as follows.

Let $S$ be the set of all values $epsilon$ for which $f$ is negative on $[)$

## Bounded functions:

Let $f$ be a function on an interval $I$. Then $f$ has an upper bound if there is a number $M$ such that $f(x) \leq M$ for all $x \in I$. Also, $f$ has a lower bound if there is a number $N$ such that $N \leq f(x)$ for all $x \in I$. We say that $f$ is bounded if it has both an upper and lower bound.

## Extreme value theorem:

Let $f$ be a continuous function on a closed interval $[a, b]$. Then $f$ is bounded on $[a, b]$ and $f$ has both a minimum and a maximum value on $[a, b]$

This is useful for optimisation problems.

## The least upper bound axiom

Every nonempty set of real numbers has an upper bound that has a least upper bound
