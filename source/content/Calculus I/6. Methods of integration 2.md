## Integration by parts

Suppose that $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ are differentiable functions if $x$. Then by product rule,
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(uv) = \frac{du}{dx}v +u \frac{dv}{dx}
$$
So reordering, we get:
$$
u \frac{dv}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}(uv) - v \frac{du}{dx}
$$
And we integrate to get
$$
\int u \frac{dv}{dx}\ dx = uv - \int v \frac{du}{dx}\ dx
$$
And simplifying the notation, we end up with 
$$
\int u \cdot dv = uv - \int v\ du
$$
Note, $\frac{dv}{dx}$ is not actually a fraction but using it in this way makes it easier to work with

ex.
Find $\int xe^x\ dx$

We first need to choose $u$ and $dv$. We take $u = x$ and $dv = e^x$ This is because it is easier to integrate $e^x$ and easier to differentiate $x$.

<u>Note</u>
$u$ is usually anything with a power of $x$ because it is easy to differentiate, in this case it's $x^1$.

Now, we have 
$$
\begin{gather*}
du = 1 (dx) \\
v = e^x
\end{gather*}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\int xe^x\ dx 
&= x \cdot e^x - \int e^x dx \\
&= x \cdot e^x - e^x + C

\end{align}
$$

ex.
Find $\int x^2 \ln x\ dx$

Assuming we can't find the derivative of $\ln x$, we can use $u = \ln x$ and $v = x^2$
So we now have:

$$
\begin{matrix}
u = \ln x & dv = x^2 \\
\frac{du}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} & v = \frac{1}{3}x^3
\end{matrix}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
\int x^2 \ln x\ dx 
&= \frac{1}{3}x^3 \cdot \ln x - \int \frac{1}{3}x^3 \cdot \frac{1}{x}\ dx \\
&= \frac{1}{3}x^3 \cdot \ln x - \frac{1}{3} \int x^2\ dx \\
&= \frac{1}{3}x^3 \cdot \ln x - \frac{1}{6}x^3 + C
\end{align}
$$
