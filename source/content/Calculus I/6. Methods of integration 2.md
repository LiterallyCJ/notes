## Integration by parts

Suppose that $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ are differentiable functions if $x$. Then by product rule,
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(uv) = \frac{du}{dx}v +u \frac{dv}{dx}
$$
So reordering, we get:
$$
u \frac{dv}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}(uv) - v \frac{du}{dx}
$$
And we integrate to get
$$
\int u \frac{dv}{dx}\ dx = uv - \int v \frac{du}{dx}\ dx
$$
And simplifying the notation, we end up with 
$$
\int u \cdot dv = uv - \int 
$$
