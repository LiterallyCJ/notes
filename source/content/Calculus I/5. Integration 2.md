# The fundamental theorem of calculus

Let $f$ be a continuous function on the interval $[a,b]$. 
Define a new function $F$ as follows. Let $x$ be a point in $[a,b]$. Let $F(x)$ be the area between the graph of $f$ and the $x$-axis that lies over the interval $[a, x]$. That is $F(x)$ is the definite integral
$$
F(x) = \int^x_af(t)dt
$$
For example, suppose the graph of $f$ lies above the $x$-axis so we are considering area under the graph. Then $F(x)$ is the area under the graph between $a$ and the point $x$. As $x$ moves towards $b$, $F$ is measuring the accumulation of additional area.

Now we come to the first part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus part 1

Let $f$ be a continuous function on the interval $[a,b]$. The function $F$ is defined by
$$
F(x) = \int^x_af(t)dt
$$
is continuous on $[a,b]$, differential on $(a,b)$ and has derivative
$$
F'(x) = f(x)
$$

<u>Proof</u>
Using the definition of the derivative:
$$
F'(x) = \lim_{x \to 0}\frac{F(x + h) - F(x)}{h}
$$
