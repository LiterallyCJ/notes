# The fundamental theorem of calculus

Let $f$ be a continuous function on the interval $[a,b]$. 
Define a new function $F$ as follows. Let $x$ be a point in $[a,b]$. Let $F(x)$ be the area between the graph of $f$ and the $x$-axis that lies over the interval $[a, x]$. That is $F(x)$ is the definite integral
$$
F(x) = \int^x_af(t)dt
$$
For example, suppose the graph of $f$ lies above the $x$-axis so we are considering area under the graph. Then $F(x)$ is the area under the graph between $a$ and the point $x$. As $x$ moves towards $b$, $F$ is measuring the accumulation of additional area.

Now we come to the first part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus part 1

Let $f$ be a continuous function on the interval $[a,b]$. The function $F$ is defined by
$$
F(x) = \int^x_af(t)dt
$$
is continuous on $[a,b]$, differential on $(a,b)$ and has derivative
$$
F'(x) = f(x)
$$

<u>Proof</u>
Using the definition of the derivative:
$$
F'(x) = \lim_{x \to 0}\frac{F(x + h) - F(x)}{h}
$$
By definition of $F$ and properties of the definite integral, we have
$$
\begin{align}
F(x + h) - F(x) 
&= \int^{x + h}_af(t)dt - \int^x_af(t)dt \\
&= \int^x_af(t)dt + \int^{x+h}_xf(t)dt  - \int^x_af(t)dt \\
&= \int^{x + h}_xf(t)dt
\end{align}
$$

Now $\int^x_af(t)dt$ is the area between the graph of $f$ and the $x$-axis that lies over $[x, x+h]$. We're thinking of $h$ as being small. Let's approximate this area by going back to triangles. 
Let $M_h$ be the maximum value of $f$ on $[x, x+h]$ and let $m_h$ be the minimum value of $f$ on $[x, x+h]$. Let $L$ be the rectangle with base $[x, x+h]$ and height $m_h$, so it's area is $hm_h$, let $U$ be the rectangle with base $[x, x+h]$ and height $M_h$ so its area is $hM_h$.
Therefore
$$
hm_h \leq \int^{x + h}_xf(t) dt \leq hM_h
$$
Since $h > 0$, if we divide through by h, we get
$$
m_h \leq \frac{1}{h}\int^{x+h}_xf(t)dt \leq M_h
$$
That is,
$$
m_h \leq \frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h} \leq M_h
$$
As $h$ approaches 0, the minimum value of $f$ on $[x, x+h]$ and the maximum value of $f$ on $[x, x+h]$ both approach $f(x)$. Therefore taking limits in all 3 terms, we obtain,
$$
f(x) \leq \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h} \leq f(x)
$$
Hence by the squeeze theorem,
$$
\lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{F(x + h) -F(x)}{h} = f(x)
$$
Therefore, $F'(x)$ exists and it equals $f(x)$
