## The fundamental theorem of calculus

Let $f$ be a continuous function on the interval $[a,b]$. 
Define a new function $F$ as follows. Let $x$ be a point in $[a,b]$. Let $F(x)$ be the area between the graph of $f$ and the $x$-axis that lies over the interval $[a, x]$. That is $F(x)$ is the definite integral
$$
F(x) = \int^x_af(t)dt
$$
For example, suppose the graph of $f$ lies above the $x$-axis so we are considering area under the graph. Then $F(x)$ is the area under the graph between $a$ and the point $x$
