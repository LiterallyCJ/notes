# The fundamental theorem of calculus

Let $f$ be a continuous function on the interval $[a,b]$. 
Define a new function $F$ as follows. Let $x$ be a point in $[a,b]$. Let $F(x)$ be the area between the graph of $f$ and the $x$-axis that lies over the interval $[a, x]$. That is $F(x)$ is the definite integral
$$
F(x) = \int^x_af(t)dt
$$
For example, suppose the graph of $f$ lies above the $x$-axis so we are considering area under the graph. Then $F(x)$ is the area under the graph between $a$ and the point $x$. As $x$ moves towards $b$, $F$ is measuring the accumulation of additional area.

Now we come to the first part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus part 1

Let $f$ be a continuous function on the interval $[a,b]$. The function $F$ is defined by
$$
F(x) = \int^x_af(t)\ dt
$$
is continuous on $[a,b]$, differential on $(a,b)$ and has derivative
$$
F'(x) = f(x)
$$

The function $F(x)$ is the accumulation function of $f(x)$ which basically means that it is the accumulated area under the curve form $f(t)$ from $t = a$ up to $t = x$. It is the area under the function $f(x)$ from a constant starting point $a$.

This basically shows that the area under the function $f$ is found using the antiderivative of $f$

<u>Proof</u>
Using the definition of the derivative:
$$
F'(x) = \lim_{x \to 0}\frac{F(x + h) - F(x)}{h}
$$
By definition of $F$ and properties of the definite integral, we have
$$
\begin{align}
F(x + h) - F(x) 
&= \int^{x + h}_af(t)\ dt - \int^x_af(t)\ dt \\
&= \int^x_af(t)\ dt + \int^{x+h}_xf(t)\ dt  - \int^x_af(t)\ dt \\
&= \int^{x + h}_xf(t)\ dt
\end{align}
$$

Now $\int^x_af(t)\ dt$ is the area between the graph of $f$ and the $x$-axis that lies over $[x, x+h]$. We're thinking of $h$ as being small. Let's approximate this area by going back to triangles. 

Let $M_h$ be the maximum value of $f$ on $[x, x+h]$ and let $m_h$ be the minimum value of $f$ on $[x, x+h]$. Let $L$ be the rectangle with base $[x, x+h]$ and height $m_h$, so it's area is $hm_h$, let $U$ be the rectangle with base $[x, x+h]$ and height $M_h$ so its area is $hM_h$.

Therefore
$$
hm_h \leq \int^{x + h}_xf(t)\ dt \leq hM_h
$$
Since $h > 0$, if we divide through by h, we get
$$
m_h \leq \frac{1}{h}\int^{x+h}_xf(t)\ dt \leq M_h
$$
That is,
$$
m_h \leq \frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h} \leq M_h
$$
As $h$ approaches 0, the minimum value of $f$ on $[x, x+h]$ and the maximum value of $f$ on $[x, x+h]$ both approach $f(x)$. Therefore taking limits in all 3 terms, we obtain,
$$
f(x) \leq \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h} \leq f(x)
$$
Hence by the squeeze theorem,
$$
\lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{F(x + h) -F(x)}{h} = f(x)
$$
Therefore, $F'(x)$ exists and it equals $f(x)$

ex.

Suppose that 
$$
\int^x_0tf(t)\ dt = \sin x
$$
Find $f(\pi)$ and $f'(\pi)$

Let $F(x) = \int^x_0tf(t)dt - \sin x$, so $F(x) = 0$. Taking derivatives,
$$
F'(x) = xf(x) - \cos x
$$
(You get the inside function but with $x$ instead of $t$)
and $F'(x) = 0$ therefore, $xf(x) = \cos x$.

For $f(\pi)$,
$$
\begin{align}
\pi f(\pi) = \cos \pi 
&\implies \pi f(\pi) = -1 \\
&\implies f(\pi) = -\frac{1}{\pi}
\end{align}
$$
## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus part 2

Part 1 states that $F(x) = \int^x_0f(t)dt$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$. Any other antiderivative of $f$, named $G(x)$ differs from $F(x)$ by a constant

Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a,b]$. If $G$ is any antiderivative of $f$, then
$$
\int^b_af(t)\ dt = G(b) - G(a)
$$

<u>Proof</u>

One antiderivative of $f$ is,
$$
F(x) = \int^x_af(t)\ dt
$$
If $G(x)$ is another antiderivative, then $F(x) - G(x) = c$ for some constant $c$. By definition of $F$, we have $F(a) = 0$, so $c = -G(a)$. Therefore, $F(x) - G(x) = -G(a)$, or $F(x) = G(x) - G(a)$. Evaluating at $x = b$ and using the definition of F, we get,
$$
F(b) = \int^b_af(t)\ dt = G(b) - G(a) 
$$

# The indefinite integral

The indefinite integral is another name for an antiderivative, but we add a constant at the end. For example, the antiderivative of $2x$ is $x^2$ and also,
$$
\int 2x\ dx =  x^2 + c
$$
