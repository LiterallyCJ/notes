_Functions_
A function f: X->Y between sets X and Y map values from one set to another
$$
\displaylines{
\text{ Domain of } f \text{ is } X \\
\text{Range of } f \text{ is the set } R \text{ of } Y,\ R = \{f(x) | x = X\}
}
$$

Types of interval

-> \[a,b] Closed interval
-> (a,b) Open interval
-> \[a,b) / (a,b] Half open interval

An injective function maps one input to one output 
	$$
	\displaylines{\text{if}\ f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2}),\ x_{1} = x_{2}}
	$$

A surjective function is one where all of the elements in the input set are mapped to all of the elements in the output set
	E.G. range( f(x) ) = Y

A function is bijective if both of these conditions are true
