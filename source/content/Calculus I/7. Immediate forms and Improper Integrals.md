## Proof of L'Hospital's Theorem

Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous functions on the closed interval $[a,b]$ which are also differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$. If $g'(x) \neq 0$, then there is an $r \in (a,b)$ such that:
$$
\frac{f'(r)}{g'(r)} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b) - g(a)}
$$

Define a function $G(x)$ by:
$$
G(x) = (g(b) - g(a)) \cdot (f(x) - f(a))-(g(x)- g(a)) \cdot (f(b) - f(a))
$$
Since $f$ and $g$ are continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$, so is G. Therefore by MVT, there is an $r \in (a,b)$ such that
$$
G'(r) = \frac{G(b) - G(a)}{b -a}
$$
