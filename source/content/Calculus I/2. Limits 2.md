## Properties of limits

$$
|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|\ \forall\ (a,b)\ \in \mathbb{R}
$$
<u>Triangle inequality</u>
$$
|a-b| \leq |a-c| + |c-b|
$$
This means that the length of one leg of the triangle is less than the length of the two other legs of the triangles combined

## Uniqueness of limits

If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ and $lim_{x \to a} f(x) = M$ then $L = M$

<u>Proof:</u>

Show that $|L - M|$ can be made arbitrarily small. This shows that $L = M$. If $L \neq M$ then $|L - M| = d$ for some distance $d > 0$. But if it can be made $|L - M|$ as small as we want, we could make it less than $d$, it is a contradiction.

Let $\epsilon > 0$. We aim to show that $|L - M| < \epsilon$ By the definition of a limit, to say $lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ means that there is a $\delta_1 > 0$ such that whenever $|x - a| < \delta_1$ we have $|f(x) - L| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Similarly, to say $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = M$ means that there is a $\delta_2 > 0$ such that whenever $|x - a| < \delta_2$ we have $|f(x) - M| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. 

- Note: $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ is being used because there are 2 epsilons. We can do this because we want the distance to be as small as possible, so dividing by 2 or any value is allowed.

Let $\delta$ be the minimum of $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$. Then when $|x-a| < \delta$ we have both $|f(x) - L| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and $|f(x) - M| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. By the triangle inequality, this implies that:
$$
\begin{align}
|L - M| &\leq |L - f(x)| + |f(x) - M| \\
&\leq |f(x) - L| + |f(x) - M| \\
&\leq \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\
&\leq \epsilon
\end{align}
$$
Therefore proving that the distance between them is arbitrarily small, and they are equal.

## The Arithmetic of Limits

Suppose that $\lim_{x \to a}f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to a} = M$ then the following hold:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\lim_{x \to a}(f(x) + g(x)) = L + M  \tag{a}\\
\lim_{x \to a}(f(x) - g(x)) = L - M \tag{b}\\
\lim_{x \to a}f(x)g(x) = L \cdot M \tag{c}\\
\lim_{x \to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{L}{M} \text { provided } M \neq 0 \tag{d}\\
\lim_{x \to a}cf(x) = cL \text{ for any constant } c \tag{e}\\
\text{if } f(x) \leq g(x) \text{ near } a \text{ then } L \leq \tag{f}M
\end{gather*}
$$
<u>Proof [a]</u>

Let $\epsilon > 0$. We wish to show that there is a $\delta > 0$ such that:
$$
|f(x) + g(x) - (L + M)| < \epsilon
$$
whenever $|x - a| < \delta$.

By the definition of the limit, to say that $\lim_{x \to a} = L$ means that there exists $\delta_1 < 0$ such that $|f(x) - L| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ whenever $|x - a| < \delta_1$. Similarly to say that $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = M$ means that there exists $\delta_2 > 0$ such that $|g(x) - M| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ whenever $|x - a| < \delta_2$.

Let $\delta$ be the minimum of $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$. Then whenever $|x-a| < \delta$ we have both $|f(x) - L| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and $|g(x) - M| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Also observe that :
$$
\begin{align}
|(f(x) + g(x)) - (L + M)| &= |(f(x) - L) + (g(x) -M)| \\
&\leq |f(x) - L| + |g(x) - M| \\
&< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon
\end{align}
$$
- Note: once again $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ was used as there are 2 epsilons which will be added together in the end to prove that it is arbitrarily small. (For neatness purposes only)
