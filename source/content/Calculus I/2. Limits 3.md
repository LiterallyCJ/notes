## One-sided limits

Suppose that $f$ is a function defined on the set $(a,b)$ where $b > a$. Then
$$
\lim_{f\to a^+}f(x) = L
$$
if for ever $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$ whenever $0 < x-a < \delta$. We say that $L$ is the right hand limit of $f(x)$.

<u>Note:</u>
- This definition is exactly the same as the normal $\epsilon$-$\delta$ definition of a limit but is only concerned with those $x$ near $a$ which also satisfy $x > a$. Thats why the absolute value disappeared in the $|x - a| < \delta$ part of the definition.

A similar definition for the left hand limit exists, however we are looking for those $x$ near $a$ which also satisfy $x < a$, so $|x -a| = a - x$.
