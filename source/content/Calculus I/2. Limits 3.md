## One-sided limits

Suppose that $f$ is a function defined on the set $(a,b)$ where $b > a$. Then
$$
\lim_{f\to a^+}f(x) = L
$$
if for ever $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$ whenever $0 < x-a < \delta$. We say that $L$ is the right hand limit of $f(x)$.

<u>Note:</u>
- This definition is exactly the same as the normal $\epsilon$-$\delta$ definition of a limit but is only concerned with those $x$ near $a$ which also satisfy $x > a$. Thats why the absolute value disappeared in the $|x - a| < \delta$ part of the definition.

A similar definition for the left hand limit exists, however we are looking for those $x$ near $a$ which also satisfy $x < a$, so $|x -a| = a - x$.

## Limits at infinity

*Informally*, $\lim_{x \to \infty}f(x) = L$ if $f(x)$ approaches $L$ as $x$ approaches $\infty$. Also, $\lim_{x \to -\infty}f(x) = M$ if $f(x)$ approaches $M$ as $x$ approaches $-\infty$.

A fundamental usage of this is that $\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{1}{x} = 0$. This makes sense because as $x$ gets larger, $\frac{1}{x}$ gets smaller and closer to 0. This becomes useful for solving limits to infinity.

ex.

$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2x^2 + 3x + 1}{5x^2-4x-2} &= \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2x^2 + 3x + 1}{5x^2-4x-2} \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{x^2}}{\frac{1}{x^2}} \\
&= \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{2 + \frac{3}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2}}{5 - \frac{4}{x} - \frac{2}{x^2}} \\
&= \frac{2}{5}
\end{align}
$$
- We see that $\frac{2}{5}$ stays because the numbers over $x$ approach 0, as $\frac{n}{x}$ approaches 0 as $x$ approaches $\infty$. Only the $\frac{2}{5}$ remains as they are constants.
