$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
$$
Denotes that as the value of $x$ approaches some value $a$, the output of the function approaches some value $L$

- Limits ignore $x=a$
- They are more about when $x$ is near $a$

Some limits can't exist. For example:
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \frac{1}{x}
$$
This function can't exist because the right side goes towards $-\infty$ and the left side goes towards $\infty$.

Formal "$\epsilon$ - $\delta$" definition of a limit:

Let $f$ be a function defined by the union of 2 intervals:
$$
\begin{gather*}
\text{let } a \lt c \text{ and } a \lt b \\
\underbrace{(c,a) \cup (a,b)}_{\text{Open limit because don't want to observe at } a}
\end{gather*}
$$
$$
\begin{gather*}
\text{Then, } \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \\
\text{ if for every } \epsilon > 0 \text{ there is a } \delta > 0 \text{ so that } |f(x) - L| < \epsilon \\
\text{whenever } |x - a| < \delta
\end{gather*}
$$
- The greek letters, $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ denote small numbers.
- The absolute values can be thought of as the distance between two numbers
	- $|f(x) - L|$ is the distance of the current $f(x)$ and the target $L$
	- $|x - a|$ is the distance between the $x$ and the final number $a$

1. Fix an $\epsilon$
2. Find a $\delta > 0$ such that when the $|x - a| < \delta$, the $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$

- The conditions of $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ must be true at the same time to prove a limit
