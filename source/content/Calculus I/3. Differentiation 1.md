## What is the derivative?

<u>Informally</u>
Start with a function $f$ and a point $x$ in the interior of the domain of $f$ (ie. $x$ is not an endpoint). Consider $f(x)$ on the graph of $f$. We want to find the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $x$.

To find the equation of a line, we need one point and its gradient at that point. We have one point, $(x, f(x))$. Now, we need to find the gradient.

The idea is to find the gradient through a series of approximations. Pick a point $x + h$ close to $x$. To simplify the argument, suppose $h > 0$. The line connecting $(x, f(x))$ and $(x+ h, f(x + h))$ is called the secant line.

This secant line approximates the tangent line. The advantage of the secant line is that its gradient is easy to calculate since we know two points on the line. The slope of the secant line is:
$$
\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{(x + h) - h} = \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$
If $h$ is made smaller, then we get a new secant line which should be a better approximation to the tangent line.

As these approximations to the tangent line improve the smaller $h$ gets, we take the limit as $h$ approaches 0 in order to get the tangent.
The gradient of the tangent line of the graph of $f$ at $x$ should be:
$$
\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$
This is used as the definition of the derivative of $f$ at $x$.

<u>Note</u>
- A function $f$ is said to be differentiable at $x$ if and only if that equation exists. If it does exist, then it is written as $f'(x)$.
- A function $f$ is differentiable on a subset $S$ of the real numbers if it is differentiable on every point $x$ in $S$.
